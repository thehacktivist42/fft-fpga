This repository contains the hardware design, simulation testbench, and complete automated verification pipeline for a **1024-point Radix-2 Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**. The core is implemented in Verilog using **16-bit Q15 fixed-point arithmetic** and is meticulously verified against a 64-bit double-precision floating-point MATLAB golden reference.

## Features
* **16-bit Q15 Fixed-Point Arithmetic**: Optimized for hardware implementation with minimal quantization loss.
* **Automated Pipeline**: A single shell script (`run.sh`) handles stimulus generation, Verilog simulation, and Python/MATLAB error analysis.
* **Golden Reference Verification**: Compares hardware outputs directly against a pristine MATLAB-generated ideal FFT.
* **Quantization Noise Analysis**: Python-based scripts to automatically calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Repository Structure

| File / Directory | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 📁 `data/fft/` | Contains generated input test vectors (`input.txt`) and reference JSONs. |
| 📁 `results/fft/` | Destination folder for simulation outputs (`output.json`). |
| 📄 `fft.v` | The core Verilog RTL implementing the bit-reversal and butterfly add/sub modules. |
| 📄 `fft-test.v` | The Verilog testbench that handles file I/O and Q-format shifting. |
| 📄 `fft_reference.m` | The MATLAB golden reference script that computes the ideal FFT and exports results. |
| 📄 `fft_error.py` | Python script that calculates MSE and RMSE by comparing Verilog outputs to the MATLAB reference. |
| 📄 `generate_input.py` | Python script to generate real/imaginary test vectors (e.g., sine waves or white noise). |
| 📄 `generate_twiddle.py` | Python script to pre-calculate and generate 16-bit two's complement twiddle factors (`.hex` files). |
| 📄 `run.sh` | The master bash script that automates the generation, simulation, and verification pipeline. |
| 📄 `tasks.md` | Project tracking and to-do lists. |

## Prerequisites

To run the full automated verification pipeline, ensure the following are installed and added to your system `PATH`:

* **Icarus Verilog** (`iverilog` & `vvp`): For compiling and simulating the RTL.
* **MATLAB** (or GNU Octave): For generating the golden reference data.
* **Python 3.x**: For test vector generation and error calculation.
  * *Required pip packages*: `numpy`

## Usage

The entire simulation and verification flow is automated via the `run.sh` shell script.

### Standard Verification Run
To run the Verilog simulation using the existing data in `data/fft/input.txt`, followed by the MATLAB reference and Python error calculation, simply execute:

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

### Randomized Stress Test
To generate a completely new set of randomized complex inputs before running the simulation pipeline, pass the `-r` (or `--random`) flag:

```bash
./run.sh -r
```

## Verification Methodology

1. **Stimulus Generation**: `generate_input.py` creates 1024 lines of complex base-10 integers.
2. **Hardware Simulation**: The Verilog testbench (`fft-test.v`) reads the text inputs, injects them into the fixed-point FFT core, and writes the scaled results to a JSON file.
3. **Golden Reference**: `fft_reference.m` processes the exact same input file using double-precision floating-point arithmetic and exports the ideal results.
4. **Error Analysis**: `fft_error.py` parses both output sets and calculates the quantization noise. Due to the 16-bit fractional truncation inherent in the hardware butterfly stages, a small but non-zero RMSE (typically < 10 units for large signals) is expected and mathematically validates the fixed-point precision.
